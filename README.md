# Vault Playbook Documentation

#### You:
Hello again.

I'd like you to write a piece of documentation for my Ansible playbook. The playbook deploys Vault clusters and creates secrets, policies and tokens based on the hierarchy that is provided by the operator who runs this playbook. All configuration parameters are being provided by the operator in a single inventory YAML structure which could look like as follows:

## Configuration Parameter Analysis

This section explains the purpose and usage of the configuration parameters in the provided inventory YAML file.

### PKI Configuration

The inventory file includes configuration for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) management with multiple Certificate Authorities (CAs), which can be used for issuing certificates for the Vault clusters.

### Vault Cluster Configuration

The inventory file defines two Vault clusters: production and development. Each cluster has its specific domain name, CA, and Shamir key configuration.

### Secrets, Policies, and Tokens

The `vault_secrets`, `vault_policies`, and `vault_tokens` dictionaries allow the operator to define and manage secrets, policies, and tokens for the deployed Vault clusters. The secrets are organized in a hierarchical structure, and policies and tokens can be associated with specific paths in the hierarchy.

### Network Configuration

The inventory file specifies network configuration parameters like IPv4 addresses, netmasks, gateways, and name servers for the Vault clusters.

### Security and Logging

The `reveal_secrets_to_console` and `reveal_secrets_to_file` parameters control the exposure of secrets during the deployment process. By default, secrets are not printed to the console and are stored in a specified file or `/dev/null` if not needed.

## Conclusion

This document has provided a detailed explanation of the configuration parameters used in the provided Ansible playbook for deploying HashiCorp Vault clusters and managing their secrets, policies, and tokens. The inventory YAML file contains a hierarchical structure that allows the operator to define and configure various aspects of the Vault cluster deployment, including network configuration, PKI management, and secrets, policies, and tokens management.


#### You:
Please, analyse the `vault_secrets`, `vault_policies` and `vault_tokens` dictionaries. Pay attention that the policies could be mentioned in a secret's definition (so that a policy could be defined or modified  in the `vault_secrets` section), and the tokens could be mentioned in policies' definitions (so they could be defined or modified in the `vault_policies` and/or `vault_secrets` sections). Please, explain this to the reader.

#### ChatGPT:
The `vault_secrets`, `vault_policies`, and `vault_tokens` dictionaries in the inventory YAML file allow the operator to define and manage secrets, policies, and tokens for the deployed Vault clusters in a hierarchical structure. Let's analyze each of these dictionaries in detail, focusing on how policies and tokens can be defined or modified within the `vault_secrets` and `vault_policies` sections.

### `vault_secrets`

This dictionary allows the operator to define secrets in a hierarchical structure. In addition to the actual secret data, it can also include policy definitions or modifications for specific secrets or secret paths. To associate a policy with a secret or a path within the `vault_secrets` section, the `__policies` key can be used, followed by the policy name and its configuration.

For example, in the provided YAML sample:

```yaml
alpha:
  __policies:
    some_policy:
      rules:
        - path: .
          capabilities: [read, list]
      weight: 1
```

The `some_policy` is defined and associated with the secret `alpha`. This policy grants `read` and `list` capabilities to the specified path (in this case, the path of the `alpha` secret).

### `vault_policies`

This dictionary allows the operator to define and manage Vault policies. Each policy contains a set of rules that grant or deny specific capabilities on certain paths within the secrets hierarchy. Additionally, tokens can be mentioned in the policy definitions, allowing them to be created or modified within the `vault_policies` section.

For example, in the provided YAML sample:

```yaml
another_policy:
  rules:
    - path: /kloudster/alpha/bravo
      capabilities: [read, list]
  tokens:
    some_token:
      orphan: true
      weight: 666
```

The `another_policy` is defined with a rule that grants `read` and `list` capabilities on the `/kloudster/alpha/bravo` path. Within the same policy definition, a token called `some_token` is defined and associated with this policy.

### `vault_tokens`

This dictionary allows the operator to define and manage Vault tokens. Each token can be associated with one or more policies, which determine the permissions and capabilities of the token.

For example, in the provided YAML sample:

```yaml
some_token:
  policies:
    - some_policy
  orphan: false
  type: service
  regenerate: true
```

The `some_token` is defined and associated with the `some_policy`. The token is not an orphan, has a `service` type, and will be regenerated if it already exists.

### Conclusion

The `vault_secrets`, `vault_policies`, and `vault_tokens` dictionaries provide a flexible way to define and manage secrets, policies, and tokens in the Vault clusters. The ability to define and modify policies and tokens within the `vault_secrets` and `vault_policies` sections allows the operator to establish relationships between these entities and manage their configurations in a hierarchical and context-aware manner.


#### You:
Nice. Also, please, explain merging of policies' and token's configuration. So, if there is the `some_policy` policy defined in the `vault_policies` dictionary, the operator can mention the same policy somewhere in the `vault_secrets` dictionary and this secret's path (it's `.` by default, but it could be changed by the operator) will be added to the `some_policy` definition.

#### ChatGPT:
When configuring policies and tokens in the `vault_secrets` and `vault_policies` dictionaries, it is possible to merge or extend the configuration of existing policies or tokens by mentioning them in different sections of the inventory YAML file. This allows the operator to add new rules or modify existing ones in a context-aware and hierarchical manner.

### Merging Policy Configurations

If a policy is defined in the `vault_policies` dictionary and then mentioned again within the `vault_secrets` dictionary, the policy configuration will be merged. The secret's path (default is `.`) will be added to the policy definition, extending the policy with the new rules and capabilities associated with the secret.

For example, if the `some_policy` is defined in the `vault_policies` dictionary as follows:

```yaml
some_policy:
  rules:
    - path: /kloudster/alpha/bravo/charlie/delta/echo
      capabilities: [read, list]
```

And then mentioned again in the `vault_secrets` dictionary:

```yaml
alpha:
  __policies:
    some_policy:
      rules:
        - path: .
          capabilities: [read, list]
      weight: 1
```

The resulting `some_policy` will have both the original rule from the `vault_policies` section and the new rule from the `vault_secrets` section, extending the policy's capabilities to the secret's path:

```yaml
some_policy:
  rules:
    - path: /kloudster/alpha/bravo/charlie/delta/echo
      capabilities: [read, list]
    - path: /kloudster/alpha
      capabilities: [read, list]
```

### Merging Token Configurations

Similarly, if a token is defined in the `vault_tokens` dictionary and then mentioned again within the `vault_policies` or `vault_secrets` dictionaries, the token configuration will be merged. This allows the operator to add or modify the policies associated with the token in a context-aware manner.

For example, if the `some_token` is defined in the `vault_tokens` dictionary as follows:

```yaml
some_token:
  policies:
    - some_policy
  orphan: false
  type: service
  regenerate: true
```

And then mentioned again in the `vault_policies` dictionary:

```yaml
another_policy:
  rules:
    - path: /kloudster/alpha/bravo
      capabilities: [read, list]
  tokens:
    some_token:
      orphan: true
      weight: 666
```

The resulting `some_token` will have both the original policy `some_policy` and the new policy `another_policy` associated with it, and its orphan status will be updated:

```yaml
some_token:
  policies:
    - some_policy
    - another_policy
  orphan: true
  type: service
  regenerate: true
```

### Conclusion

The ability to merge policy and token configurations within the `vault_secrets` and `vault_policies` dictionaries enables the operator to manage policies and tokens in a flexible, context-aware, and hierarchical manner. The operator can extend or modify existing policies and tokens by mentioning them in different sections of the inventory YAML file, ensuring that the resulting configuration accurately represents the desired access control and permissions.


#### You:
Ah, you're so brilliant kid! Thank you. :-)

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a great day!


#### You:
Oh, can you also explain another few of aspects to the reader.
1. Please, explain the building of the PKI tree, as this feature deserves some attention. The playbook generates all the certificates as a certification tree, so the operator could make it issuing the root certificates, a chain of intermediate certificates and a separate certificate for each Vault cluster.
2. The operator isn't limited to the prodiction and development environments only. The playbook could deploy as many environments as its being asked to.

#### ChatGPT:
1. Building the PKI tree:

The inventory YAML file provides a way to define and manage a hierarchical Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) tree for the Vault clusters. The PKI tree is built using a certification chain that starts with a root certificate and could include a chain of intermediate certificates, ultimately leading to separate certificates for each Vault cluster.

In the provided YAML sample, the PKI tree is defined using the `pki_ca_list` key under the `vars` section:

```yaml
pki_ca_list:
  - ca_name_brief: root
    ...
  - ca_name_brief: vault_production
    ...
    ca_parent: root
  - ca_name_brief: vault_development
    ...
    ca_parent: root
```

Here, the `root` certificate is defined as the top-level root certificate authority (CA). Two intermediate CAs, `vault_production` and `vault_development`, are defined with `root` as their parent, which means they will be signed by the `root` CA.

This hierarchical structure allows the operator to create a robust PKI tree, ensuring the trustworthiness and security of the certificates issued for each Vault cluster. The root certificate acts as the ultimate trust anchor, while the intermediate certificates provide additional layers of trust and allow for the separation of responsibilities across different environments or organizational units.

2. Deploying multiple environments:

The Ansible playbook is flexible enough to deploy multiple environments as required by the operator. The provided YAML sample demonstrates the deployment of two environments, `production` and `development`, but the playbook can be easily extended to handle any number of environments by modifying the inventory file.

To deploy additional environments, the operator can add new child groups under the `vault_clusters` group, with appropriate configuration parameters. Each environment should have its own unique identifier and a set of hosts.

For example, to create a new `staging` environment, the operator can add the following configuration to the inventory YAML file:

```yaml
children:
  ...
  vault_clusters:
    ...
    children:
      ...
      vault_staging:
        vars:
          domain_name: tower.staging.kloudster.net
          ca_name_brief: "vault_staging"
          ...
        hosts:
          vault1.staging:
            ansible_host: 10.13.127.21
          vault2.staging:
            ansible_host: 10.13.127.22
          vault3.staging:
            ansible_host: 10.13.127.23
```

Here, the `vault_staging` group is added as a child of the `vault_clusters` group, with its own configuration variables and hosts. The operator can customize the settings for each environment as needed, providing greater flexibility in deploying and managing Vault clusters across multiple environments.

In summary, the Ansible playbook provides a powerful and flexible way to build a hierarchical PKI tree and deploy Vault clusters across multiple environments. The operator can easily extend the playbook to handle various use cases and environments, ensuring a secure and scalable infrastructure for managing secrets, policies, and tokens.
